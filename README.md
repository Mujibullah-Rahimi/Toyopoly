# TOYOPOLY

It is apparent that children quickly tire of their toys and move on to the next one as they grow. This app is for the community of parents whose children outgrow their toys quickly. Instead of buying brand new toys every few monthsâ€™ parents can put their toys on the app and exchange them with other parents who are in the same shoes.

Through a innovative token system, the users can trade their toys in exchange for tokens which can be reused when a parent is looking for and wants to buy new toys. Also supporting a form of giving away unused toys is also one of the features that makes this app so attractive for its users.

> Our name "Toyopoly" stems from the word polypoly which means "The presence of a large number of relatively small buyers and sellers, none of whom can influence the     price of commodities", this coupled with of course the word the whole idea revolves around, created our name Toyopoly where our aim is to make a community of parents     and others which help themselves by helping eachothers.
